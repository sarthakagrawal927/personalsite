Everyone knows comfort zone is the killer of dreams. Comfort zone is a position where you feel confortable and safe. You are probably not challenging yourself, as solving challenges is not comfortable. If you are not challenging yourself, your mental, physical or emotional muscles are not growing (they probably are weakening). Also known as losing your touch.

A good percentage of people realise that they are in comfort zone, they know what they need to do to get out of it. They know they won't fullfill their goals if they stay there.

Very few people actively try to get out of their comfort zone. It may not always be fun, but they do it anyway as statistically it pays off quite well.

People have different comfort zones in different fields. Some people are extremely comfortable in social situations, but struggle with technical challenges. So even fewer people get out of their comfort zones in fields that will be most beneficial for them.

It can be easy to visualise (predict), the 4 categories mentioned above would form a pyramid of success with last category at the top. It is worth mentioning. there is a 5th category, that does not really care about any of these things, they are either satisfied or ignorant. They mostly won't come across this article.

The purpose of this article is to help you realise the pyramid level you are in and hopefully help you get to the next level.

## Trying to get out of the zone
Assuming you have achieved some realization or have some goals, you would want to get out of the comfort zone. This is to be honest just facing hardships and actually keep going. Just be okay with doing the hard things. You need to do it by making it your choice. And understand that it will be rewarding in the long run.

## Picking the right zone
It's often possible for highly productive people to pick the wrong zone. They may be growing in a field that isn't beneficial for them. Also most confort zone has lograthmic growth, so very often the effort is not in proportion to the growth. Prioritization & continous evaluation is key here.
