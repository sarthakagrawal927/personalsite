I still sometimes find it hard to believe that it is 2024 already. And it has been over 4.5 years since the release of Avengers: Endgame. Time indead [flies](/blog/2023/12/30-time-flies-fast). I do not believe in the power of resolutions, but I think it can give you a starting boost of motivation. I just need to convert that motivation into habits by attaching them to my [this year's goals](/blog/2023/12/31-oh-dear-next-year).

## Career

Try to get US dollars. 3 options: Salary, Funding or Revenue from Micro SaaS. Will try to get all 3 in first half & then double down on whatever has the highest probability.
- Funding: Continue working on [Stumble](https://getstumble.app). Seems promising.
- Revenue: Build many Micro SaaS. I have a few ideas. Will try to release one every month.
- Salary: Need to write about tech & put myself out there.

All the have this as common: build, learn & write. Also, I intend to be the best at my company by end of first half.

### Build
Building Stumble itself is quite challenging, my work at my company is also fun. Adding micro-sass into the mix should be more than sufficient to check off the build box.

### Learn
Need to overkill at the [basics](/blog/2024/01/03-importance-of-cs-concepts) & work my way up there. Will mostly follow these resources: blogs, roadmaps, books, my personal [collection](https://github.com/sarthakagrawal927/dev_learning), courses & random exploration. Pretty standard stuff.

### Write
Mostly will start writing my learnings from the above in weekly technicial blogs for now. Learnings from building Micro SaaS and whatever else I can share from the other 2. Can also write about specific topics in detail. Medium, bit of twitter and this blog should be enough. Can pick linkedIn after some confidence.


## Fitness

I think for this I just need to avoid [bad habits](/blog/2023/12/28-vices-and-other-harmful-things) & show up to gym most days. Last year I went to gym 103 times with highest monthly count of 13 in Jan. This makes it clear that my gym attendance was consistently poor last year. Might pick up some sports as regular, martial arts or dancing if I can prioritize.

I hope to have a dramatic shift in my fat to muscle ratio this year. Currently it is quiet poor in my opinion.

I intend to take even more care of my mental health, being nice to myself in particular. To me reading seems like a form of meditation, so I am hoping to prioritze it more as compared to my other activities.


## Relationships

Most likely this year again it will take a backseat, hopefully unlike last year I will utilize this time properly instead of wasting away. I intend to stay in touch with my family & close friends never the less. Most of my socialization happens at work itself, so not very worried about it. I do want to make new friends though who have similar goals. So hoping to meet them at fitness activities or meetups that I plan to attend.

Actively considering joining some Guitar class & Toastmaster club for self development. Here's to hoping I can prioritize them.

Not planning anything active, most activities will be passive in the field and will be a due second order effects of my other goals. Once I hit 24 in August, I'll let my emotional position decide my future course of action.
