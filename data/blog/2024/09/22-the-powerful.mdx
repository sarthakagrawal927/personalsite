> Dopamine & Pain Are Temporary, Power Is Permanent

In my opinion, power can be categorized into four broad categories, one special category, and one multiplying category:

1. Money
2. Physical Health
3. Brain
4. Relationships
5. Special Category: Attractiveness
6. Multiplying Category: Luck

One can argue that the special category and the multiplying category can be by-products of the four broad categories, but I have decided to acknowledge them separately. Let's look at all categories in small detail—how to attain them and why they are important.

Also, one really simple but interesting thing: having one power makes getting other powers easier in some way or another. So getting on the compound benefit curve is important. Having one ability or connection can help you get other abilities or connections. Having just one of them in ample supply will open up a lot of doors for you, give you plenty of confidence, and probably be the guiding factor in your life. Imagine having multiple.

Let's look at them in detail in this format:
1. What is it? What do I mean here with it?
2. What does it do? (If not obvious)
3. How to get it? And how to maintain it or grow it?

## Money
- Money refers to financial resources and assets—essentially, your wealth.
- Money provides security, freedom, and opportunities. It allows you to meet your needs, pursue your desires, and invest in other areas of your life.
- The best odds for plain success are getting the best possible job. The best opportunity considering risk and reward is starting a business. Money can grow on its own if invested wisely.

## Physical Health
- Strength, stamina, flexibility, agility—the overall well-being of your body.
- Good physical health leads to longevity and a better quality of life. It enables you to perform daily tasks efficiently and reduces the risk of diseases.
- Through curated exercise routines, proper nutrition, and consistent ample sleep. Regular physical activity and a balanced diet are key.

## Brain
- Intelligence, memory, mental well-being, fortitude, and knowledge.
- A strong mind enhances decision-making, problem-solving abilities, and resilience against stress.
- Learn continuously, both from formal education and experiences. Solve problems, meditate, and engage in activities that challenge your mind.

## Relationships
- Family, friends, mentors, colleagues, and your general network.
- Relationships provide support, opportunities, and enrich your life emotionally and socially.
- Be loyal and helpful. Initiate connections by reaching out to others, and nurture those relationships through communication and acts of kindness.

## Attractiveness (Special Category)
- Physical appearance and the qualities that make one appealing to others.
- Attractive people often get unfair advantages in various aspects of life, though it can sometimes be a double-edged sword.
- Focus on hygiene, grooming, caring for your appearance, fashion sense, and fitness. The rest is influenced by genetics.

## Luck (Multiplying Category)
- The favorable chance events that occur beyond one's control.
- Everything in life is based on odds; imagine the odds being tilted in your favor for unlikely events.
- While luck can't be controlled, you can increase your exposure to opportunities. Stay open-minded, take calculated risks, and be prepared to seize opportunities when they arise.

(Seems kind of incomplete; I will write more when I can find better words.)

Writing this made me realize how interconnected they are and the boosts they give are common between them. After removing the obvious and common things, there wasn't really much to write about the powers.

Almost all decisions you make will have an affect on atleast one of the powers, try to make the affect positive.

Also, whom you are born to matters a lot. You have to do something out of the ordinary to fall far from the tree. You can do it, though—plenty have done it before, and plenty will do it after you.
