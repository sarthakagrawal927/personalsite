> Dopamine & pain are temporary, power is permanant.

In my opinion, power can be categories in 4 broad categories, 1 special category and 3 multiplying categories.

- Money
- Physical Health
- Brain
- Relationships

Special: Attractiveness
Multiplying Category: Luck

One can argue that the special category and multiplying category can be a result of by-products of the 4 broad categories. But still I decided to acknowledge them separately. Let's look at all categories in small detail - how to attain and why they are important.

Also one really simple but interesting thing, having one power makes getting other powers easier in some way or other. So getting on the compound benefit curve is important. Having one abilty/connection can help you get other abilities/connections. Having just one of them ample will open up alot of doors for you, give you plenty confidence & probably be the guiding factor in your life. Imagine having multiple.

Lets look at them in detail in this format:
- What is it? What do I mean here with it?
- What it does? (If not obvious)
- How to get it? And how to maintain it or grow it?

## Money
- nil
- nil
- Best odds for plain success is getting the best possible job. Best opportunity considering risk & reward is starting a business. Can grow on its own, if invested wisely.

## Physical Health
- strength, stamina, flexibility, agility, etc. Well being of body.
- Longevity.
- Curated exercise, nutrition, consistent ample sleep.

## Brain
- intelligence, memory, well being, fortitude, knowledge, etc.
- nil
- Learn (+ from experiences), solve problems, meditate.

## Relationships
- Family, Friends, Mentors, Colleagues, general network.
- nil
- Be loyal & helpful. initiate.

## Attractiveness
- nil
- attractive people get unfair advantage almost everywhere, though I can understand why *sometimes* it can be a double edged sword.
- hygine, grooming, caring, fashion, fitness, etc. Rest genetics.

## Luck
- nil
- everthing in life is based on odds, imagine the odds being tilted in your favour for unlikely events.
- nil (get a four leaf clover XD)

(Seems kinda incomplete, will write more when I can find better words)

Writing this made me realise how much interconnected they are, and the boosts they give are common between them. After removing the obvious and common things, there wasn't really much to write about the powers.

Also how much to whom you are born to matters. You have to do something out of the ordinary to fall far from the tree. You can do it though, plenty have done it before, and plenty will do it after you.
