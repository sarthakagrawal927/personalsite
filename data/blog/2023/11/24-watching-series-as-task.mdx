summary: 'Watching series as a task & how it makes you watch more'
---

Imagine having watched over 150 series, few sitcoms, few action, few anime, few korean and many more. There are times when I have played the series at 1.25x, skipped bunch of episodes because they seamed filler, just to finish the series quickly as if it were a task that didn't matter how it was completed. I was right about one thing, it didn't matter.

Watching TV Series is one of the few things I enjoy in my life, I like to appreciate good television. But recent tendencies of watching the scheduled series as a task has made me realise it has become a chore. I watch them not to talk about it with others but just for getting fullfilled like completing an important task.

There are days I watched over 12hrs, there are days I had absolute no time but I still took out the time to watch the series that I am not enjoying as much as I should. I had tricked my mind into thinking that it made me feel good, it was an easy task checked. I had made it a priority to get the small win of finishing few episodes of a series.

That's why I have decided that I should an lower limit to the amount of series & neither let my brain create mental goals for them to complete. I should just prioritise on better things & when I need time to cool off, I can watch the series I want to watch with an upper limit in mind. Scheduled things that are not very enjoyable seem forced, specially when the brain is designed to consider a feel good task. So watching series is not a goal, it should just be a way to enjoy the time, while focusing on better priorities in the driver seat.
