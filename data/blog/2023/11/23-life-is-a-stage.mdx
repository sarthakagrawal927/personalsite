There are a lot of articles about how we should have control over our lives & how important it is to be in the driving seat of your life.

> Life is a stage, you are the lead, rest all are just there to play their part.

Every decision you make, it should be yours and yours alone. Learning to say no is a skill, gaining freedom from FOMO. Most successful people are incredible at this. They say no to most things & prioritise what they feel is most important.

Most people let others make the decision for them & some make wrong decisions. Being good at decision making & actively choosing for the right priority is crucial. Why would you let someone who is a side character in your play, make the choices for you.

Some wrong decisions are instant regret, while some you regrest later on. You should definitely try to avoid the first & be mindful about the later.

Being mindful about one's choices is crucial.
