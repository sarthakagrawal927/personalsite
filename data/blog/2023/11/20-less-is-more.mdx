summary: 'Importance of focusing on less things and doing them well'
---

Recently a lot of has been going on in my mind regarding verious tech stacks, fields & projects.

There is just too much to explore, learn and make. If someone tries to build everything they will end up building nothing. While it is important to expand on knowledge and explore new things, it is also important to get in depth knowledge in some fields.

Currently the things I want to explore are way too many: AI, WEB3, DBs, App Dev, Devops, Advanced Algorithms, System Programming to name a few. And don't get me started on the new languages I want to try and projects I want to build. Because of the sheer huge number I end up getting either overwhelmed or planning too much and not doing anything.

To counter this I have decided to focus certain periods of time for specific fields to gain extra clarity. For the remaining of the year 2023, I have decided to cut down few things & focus on lesser goals.

- Building [Stumble](https://getstumble.app) - A social media app to help people meet in real life. Using NodeJS (with TS) for backend, flutter for app. Managing all deploments on AWS. Postgres for DB. This will help me gain more depth in my backend & DB skills, while nurturing my flutter & infra skills.

- Building SignificantHobbies - An all-in-one productivity tool for myself, that will have all the features I need from an app. Once ready will try to release it as SaaS. Building this in NextJS & Golang for backend. This will help me revisit the cutting edge frontend technologies while improving my golang skills.

- CMU DB Course, I have been delaying it for far too long now. I have been fascinated with DB internals for a while now.

Other than that I hope to read books, blogs, [roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh) & [my personal stash](https://github.com/sarthakagrawal927/dev_learning). No hard and fast rule on this. Along with this I hope to write more blogs like this & try to build an audience on [twitter](https://twitter.com/sarthakcodes). Do not want to spend too much time curating content so will post about whatever new I learn or build.

Had to put a pause on my craze for new fancy things I want to try but didn't do much (elixir, rust, AI, fancy algorithms). Will see how things go and re-evaluate in 2024.
