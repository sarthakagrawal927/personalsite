Life is hard, it will throw curveballs at you when you are down. Sometimes it is overwhelmingly difficult. But optimisim is powerful & can get you past most situations.

Eveb when you feel that life can't get any worse, it sometimes gets & there is little you can do about it. For times like this its better to feel delusional optimism, instead of being pessimistic.

Making important life decisions based on delusional optimism is not a good idea. But when you are down, it can help you get back up. Always remember life is all about probability and choices. So if odds are against you, you can still make a choice to be optimistic (delusional if need be).

## Startups are hard

Any reasonable person would look at the success rate of startups and say its probably not a good idea to start one. But if you are a founder, you have to be extremely optimistic about the idea, almost irrationaly. Because consistency is a key & you can't be consistent if not for your optimism.

But like all other things, too much of optimism is not a good idea. I feel being a realist with plenty of optimism is the best way to go about it. But if you are feeling extreme cases, its fine to be delusional as long as it gets you out of the bed in the morning.
