I really liked the dialogue from the anime [The Eminence in Shadow](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14115938/)

<blockquote>
I've divided the world into 2 categories: the things that matter, and the things that don't.

Why? Because I had a dream that would never come true if I didn't. We only have so much time, and so much effort. So I dedicated all of time and effort to what mattered, and I cut myself lose from everything else.

But there is too much static to let us do that. The static clouds the world and hides the things that matter. It is so for easy for people to lose sight of what's really important. If you ask me, the world is too bright. You see too many things, thats why you lose track of what matters.

This makes you ponder what really matters for you. The truth is, most people including myself have little idea of it. We often keep ourselves busy to not think about it. There are multiple books on this, aiming to ignite the spark of self discovery and explain the advantage it gives you when you have a purpose.

We sometimes chase goals with no real end in mind, its a good idea to recursively ask yourself why you are doing something, going deeper in the stack. In almost all stories, the better the character, the clearer their purpose is. Having a strong purpose automatically gives you tenacity, resilience, the happiness advantage and many other things. It often makes up for lack of talent or even discipline.

Someone with talent, discipline and purpose would be unstoppable. But like everyone says, Start with Why. If you have to pick one, pick purpose. It will often be a strong factor to built up the other two.

It is definitely possible to succeed for short term via short term purpose, but you will very soon outgrow it. Most above average successful people are in a constant cycle of outgrowing thier purpose and finding a new one. Always chasing the next high.

While I feel it is a pretty good way to live. But if you really want your purpose to last, it has to be something that is bigger than you as a single entity. Something that has the potential to outlive you.
