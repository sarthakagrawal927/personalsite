# Every day is a new episode

Imagine your life is an anime, where every day is a new episode, you are the main character & there are multiple arcs.

You have your own set of powers, goals & relationships.

You can consider an episode's rating as the amount of results (fun, tasks & improvements) you get out of it. It's up to you to decide the percentage of filler episodes you want. You have limited episodes. You can engage in different arcs where you work on one or many aspects of life. You can have celebratory episodes in which all you do is have fun. You can have flashback episodes in which you introspect.

From the viewer's perspective, to make the anime more pleasing to watch, we can improve the following:
- growth of the main character
- decreasing the number of filler episodes
- challenge the main character with more difficult crises
- making the arcs more engaging

The life version of this would be to improve daily, take on hardships & have fun while doing it. Making every episode count.

Doing your best to keep the viewer engaged works best for both of you.
