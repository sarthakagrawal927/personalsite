## Year in review
This year has been quite uneventful. Here are the major things that took most of my time:

- [Work at front.page](https://tungsten-cesium-c0c.notion.site/My-Contributions-2bb219ac00714c429a1775e1b46048ad?pvs=74)
- [Building Stumble](https://www.getstumble.app/)
  - Got the MVP Ready (including basic deployment & ground work for official release)
  - Applied & got rejected by multiple accelerators (YC said our appl. was in top 10% tho)
- [Watching plenty of Anime](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls563738714/)
- Bunch of failed goals (yet again) & plenty of partying.
- Gained some weight & wisdom.
- Made mistakes, undermined importance of relationships & went plenty of times out of my comfort zone.
- Included few new habits & dropped some old ones.
- Financially, stock market grew alot this year.

I like the stats, I wonder whether there is something higher than 1% in wakatime. Will hopefully find out this year.

## Goals for 2024
I just want to do everything I couldn't in last 2 years. Along with some extra steps in career. Here's an assorted list:

- I understand the importance of earning in US dollars. I will try to be closer to that currency. Either through job, fund raise for my startup or MRR from my side projects.
- Build multiple microstartups while doing day job & working on Stumble.
- Learn tech in much more depth, both widening & deepening my knowledge.
- Start writing about different things.
- Work on self: more gym and hopefully MMA, dance & guiter classes. Aim is to get close to peak physique.
- Be better connected to friends & family.
- Read more & watch less tv.
- Work much more harder, this is the year. LFG.
