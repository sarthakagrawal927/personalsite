Following this thread on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/16lzwwx/why_does_it_feel_like_time_is_flying_faster_on_a/), I decided to ponder upon this topic.

Few common reasonsings for why this happens are:

- It is related to how long we have lived. Every next year is a smaller percentage of your entire life.
- Due to plenty of repititive experiences, we don't remember them as much as we remember new experiences. So, it feels like time is flying fast.
- Stress & time pressure speed up the day.
- Time is observed differently by adults & kids. Kids associate time with events, whereas adults start comprehending it as length.

I feel the above reasons when combined together, can explain why time flies fast.

Regarding how to slow it down, I would recommend the following: (take directly from the post)

- Try new things.
- Practice Mindfulness, ie staying in the present.
- Challenge yourself, learn new things.
- Travel, explore & create memories
- Limit Caffiene & Screentime
