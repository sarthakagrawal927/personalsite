There are way to many vices to be covered in a single post. For now I will go with vices that directly affect physical health.

The primary things that I feel affect one's physical health & accelerate the aging process are:

- Genetics

  This is something one has no control. A lot of diseases or ability to fight diseases is dependent on genetics. People underestimate the importance to feel in control. More about this in the post on [Luck](/blog/2023/10/29-luck).

- Vices

  Smoking, drinking, drugs, sugar, junk food etc. are all consumable vices that affect one's health. This is something one has control over, having control over this needs strong emotianal control. These are addicting but not so bad if controlled well. Social Media & lack of sleep are also similar vices, one needs to tread carefully with these.

- Accidents

  Things that just happen because you are on the unforgiving end of probability. However this is something once can avoid by being careful & taking precautions. These are simple things that everyone knows about, but still ignore. It's almost never worth the risk.

Other than these 3 I would like to add exposure to Sunlight to the list. So do yourself a favour & use sunscreen when necessary.
