# Next Orbit as a person

Everyone wants to improve. Few do, ever fewer do dramatically, ie go to next orbit.

I feel like everyone shifts their orbits when they drastically change their lives. For example, when a toddler starts school, a school student starts college & when a colege student starts working. Changing orbits during these time is not optional.

But what about once you start working, what can be done to change orbits & be the best version of yourself?

There will usually be little changes in your lifestyle, not enough to change orbits. To change orbits, I think the basic requirement is to know that there exists a next orbit for you. You need to understand how much better you can be & what you are capable of. You WANT to get to the next orbit.

There are 2 primary ways to do this I feel:

- Gradual daily improvememt. 1% better everyday mathematically results in approx 37x improvement in a year. Sooner or later you will find yourself in the next orbit in your chosen field.

- Other way is more rough and probably requires even more grit. Start doing things that you are most uncomfortable with, have a clear fullfilling goal in mind & chase it. Switch gears and do something totally new. This way you can change orbits faster, but few are able to plan for this, and even fewer are able to execute it.

I would recommend based on your goals & your dedication towards them try to atleast start moving via the first path. If you are able to do that, you will be able to figure out the second path for yourself.
