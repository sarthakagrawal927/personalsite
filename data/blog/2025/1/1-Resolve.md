## Year in review
This year has was more eventful than last. But I am still far from satisfied with the progress I made. Here are the major things that took most of my time:

- [Work at front.page](https://tungsten-cesium-c0c.notion.site/My-Contributions-2bb219ac00714c429a1775e1b46048ad?pvs=74)
- [Building Stumble](https://www.getstumble.app/)
  - Iterations, but no real result. Discussions & daydreaming about success was fun tho.
  - Couldn't figure out how to retain users and solve the chicken-egg problem.
- [Watching plenty of Anime](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls563738714/)
- Went out much more, played a lot of sports and met new people.
- Got some bad habits (they are the target of elimination), improved some others.
- Achieved daily steps goal.$$
- Worked and ideated on bunch of side projects, but nothing concrete came out of it.

## Goals for 2025
Here's an assorted list:

- See how hard I can work. (Money, Brain)
- Gaining deeper knowledge about databases, llms & infra. (Money, Brain)
- Continue sports and gym regularly. Follow a better diet. (Physical Health, Relationships)
- Discard bad habits. (too many to list here).
- Read, Write (goals, gratitude) & have proper sleep schedule. (Brain)
- Steps goal: 12.4k avg. (Physical Health)
- Don't worry about social aspect, just go out more and talk to people you like. (Relationships)
- Keep at least 3:1 ratio of work:play. Track it well. (Brain, Money)
- Write monthly reviews like this.
- Learn things and build stuff. Share it with the world. (Brain, Money)

The one thing that I have made after 3 years working professionally (after college, ie living like an adult): Resolve. A resolve to do what it takes to become who I want to be.
