I started out this year with reasonably ambitious goals. Alas, I am not close to any of them. But that doesn't mean I wasted my time.

My first month was mostly spent at being crossroads at multiple things: my current job, new startup job, stumble & a startup I wanted to join as CTO. One day I just decided to quit them all to free up my mind, since none of them were hell yes. After that I was lost since I had no idea what to do and for the first time since college I was jobless. After spending few days just chilling and goofing around and not making any progress in any projects, I realized I need to get a job to get some structure in life.

Luckily I got a job quickly (it paid decent, was growth stage startup, remote and workload seemed to be something I would enjoy). The job in itself was fine, had a brief learning curve and its ups and downs like a standard job. Nothing to complain about.

After trying to do all things, I realized I was trying too many things resulting in progress of none. I played a lot, but ended up hurting my lower back. Now just spending in walking and fixing up my core and lower back. I am hoping this injury nudged me in a overall fitter direction.

Financially, market has started to recover a bit, yet still far from peak. Also for the first time I sold some stocks in loss. Ever since my new job, I have grown way too open for online subs and bought too many of them. Even for ones I thought previously were total waste of money.

I finished some anime and played a lot of games, went on few trips. Attended weddings. Tried guitar and chess classes.

Overall, I think I have improved financially, socially and healthwise this year. My learnings have taken a hit though, for which I have decided to take small steady steps. And also instead of annual goals, I'll start doing monthly *easy* goals.

- do daily: 2hr focus work, exercise, meds (+creatine), drink whey and read hckrnews
- avg sleep 7hr (had achieved now just need to prevent it from derailing)
- get avg step count to 8.3k (currently 7.4k) & get my back fixed
- start using deployed LifeOS app for my personal use case & have v0 of personal assistant ready.

That's it.
