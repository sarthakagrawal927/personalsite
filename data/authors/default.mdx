## Software
I am a generalist software engineer with good command over multiple technologies. You can checkout out my [github](https://github.com/sarthakagrawal927) and my [contributions](https://tungsten-cesium-c0c.notion.site/My-Contributions-2bb219ac00714c429a1775e1b46048ad) to [front.page](https://front.page) to know about 70% of my work I have done till now.

The tech stack I am most comfortable with would be React & NodeJS (TS). I have worked enough with Python, Go & Dart (Flutter) to be able to start contributing immediately. Other than that I have dabbled a bit with Rust & Elixir for fun. I also did C,C++ & Java during college but did not use them later on. I am extremely open to new languages. I have worked with multiple technologies:

-MySQL
- Redis
- ElasticSearch
- PostgreSQL
- AWS
- GCloud
- Firebase
- Docker
- Kubernenetes (Helm)
- Kafka (& Zookeeper)
- & Clickhouse during my work.

Some web frameworks I have played around with are NextJS, SolidJS, Gatsby, Astro, Remix, RedwoodJS (Jamstack)

Note:This is not an exhaustive list.

## Startups
I like social, finance & self-development products. Other than these I am very excited about working in [Databases](https://github.com/stars/sarthakagrawal927/lists/databases-more), [Dev tools](https://github.com/stars/sarthakagrawal927/lists/tools), [heavy AI](https://github.com/stars/sarthakagrawal927/lists/ai) or [PaaS](https://github.com/stars/sarthakagrawal927/lists/infra). Web3 also sounds fascinating.

I like all types of businesses & have recently taken a liking to culture of Micro-SaaS.

## Other Interests
My other major interests right now include:
        - Stocks & Finance
        - Anime & other cool TV Shows and movies
- Gymming & other fitness activities
- Reading random interest based books & occasionally Writing
- Playing sports (Badminton, Table Tennis, Cricket, Football, Foosball, Carrom, Chess, Pool etc.)
